/*You can declare a variable by typing 
let thing; What is the value of thing?
*/


//When I declare a variable using let in JavaScript without initializing it, the value of the variable is undefined.
let thing;
console.log(thing); 

//The variable thing is declared using let, but it is not assigned any value.
//When I log thing to the console, it outputs undefined because thing has not been initialized with any value.
